What are time series models? Why do we need them when we have less complicated regression models?

We need time series models because of a fundamental assumption of most standard regression models: No autocorrelation. 
In layman’s terms, this means that a data point’s values in the present are not influenced by the values of data points in the past. 
The fundamental example is stock prices: stock prices on one day are clearly influenced by the stock’s price on the previous day. 
It wouldn’t make sense for a stock that was $100 one day to suddenly be $5 the next day and $1000 the day after in normal market 
conditions. If this assumption is violated in traditional regression models, the parameters,β, would blow up to astronomical levels 
and result in an extremely large R SQUARED value. This is because the model will try to fit the parameters assuming that there is 
no autoregression, resulting in the model wildly overestimating the parameters because it doesn’t take into account the 
natural inflation of data point values as time goes on.

Thus, in order to do valid inference on data that has autocorrelation, we need models that control for autocorrelation like ARIMA.
