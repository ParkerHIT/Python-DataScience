What are the Z and t tests? What are they used for? 
What is the difference between them? 
When should use one over the other?


Both the Z-test and the t-test are statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. 
They are commonly used in hypothesis testing and are appropriate for comparing means of samples to population parameters 
or comparing means between two samples.


A z-test is a statistical test to determine whether two population means are different 
when the variances are known and the sample size is large. A z-test is a hypothesis test 
in which the z-statistic follows a normal distribution. 
A z-statistic, or z-score, is a number representing the result from the z-test.

A t-test is any statistical test that uses the t, or Student’s t, family of distributions 
to compare two means to see if they are significantly different from each other. 
Typically, t-tests are conducted when the population’s standard deviation is unknown, or there is a small sample size.

Like all hypothesis tests, the Z and t tests work by calculating the probability of the opposite of the 
hypothesis we want to test. The Z and t tests are identical in almost every way:

They both assume the samples from the population follow a normal distribution 
They both have the same null and alternative hypothesis 
They both use the same test statistic, namely (μ^​−μ0)/(s/n), 
where s is the sample standard deviation and n is the sample size. 
The only difference between them is that they use a different probability distribution function (pdf) 
(and thus, cumulative distribution function) to calculate their p-value.
