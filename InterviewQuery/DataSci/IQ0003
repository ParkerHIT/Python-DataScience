What are the assumptions of linear regression?

1) Linear relationship - predictors should be linearly correlated to response. Check with scatter plot. 
If not, apply appropriate transformation. Also check for outliers as linear regression is sensitive to this.

2) Multivariate normality - residuals are normally distributed - Check with histogram.

3) No multicollinearity - All the variance in your predictors should explain the variance in your response 
ie predictors should not be correlated to each other. Check with correlation matrix or VIF.

4) No auto-correlation - refers to correlation between values of same variable. 
This will result in bias in your standard error which will make your P value unreliable ie garbage model.
Check with Durbin-Watson test (want value close to 2).

5) Homoscedasticity - variance of your errors should be constant across regression line.
